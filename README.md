__Author: R. Alex Clark__
***
Tooltip is a simple iOS application designed for iPhone 5 / 6  

## Features

* Simple home screen for input of total bill amount which displays the relative tip and total cost provided
* Easy to use slider for adjusting the tip percentage of the current bill
* Settings screen to change the bounds of the currently set tip slider, used to increase or localize a frequently used tip amount
* Save and Reset features for the custom bound settings for ease of use on next actvation

# Walkthrough

The app is selected from the home screen and from here a tip amount is selected. This tip amount defaults to the median of the selected bounds of the application's sliders settings. These settings can be changed in the settings screen.   

After a bill amount has been entered into the input field, the tip and total amounts will update to match it. The tip percentage can be altered based on the slider, and the tip and total costs will live update to match the amount of tip given based on the bill.

You can set custom bounds for the tip slider, allowing you to easily change the window of selection for the slider. This is done using the settings screen.

Finally, the settings are saved using the save button, and custom settings can easily be reset using the reset button featured in the settings screen.

## Submission Details

I really liked working on this application even with my little experience in iOS development. I wish I knew more about the process and shortcuts, tips, ect. for using the Xcode IDE and Swift 2 language, but I think that for a first ever attempt that this production turned about pretty well.
